Logical Gate is an educational game in a 2d platformer style covering logic gates and binary arithmetic.

Instructions

Once published, the user can access the game on the Unity Play website with the following link:
https://play.unity.com/en
and search for Logical Gate. The game will start at the title screen.

The game utilizes standard keyboard controls, moving the character with the 'w','a','s', and 'd' keys. The 
'a' and 'd' will move left or right respectively; the 'w' key is the key to jump; the 's' key can be used 
to fall through platforms on specific platforms in the game. The player can also slow their falling speed 
by wall sliding, which is done by holding down the 'a' or 'd' key to push into a wall. While wall-sliding, 
the player can "wall jump", by hitting 'w' while wall sliding. 

The game starts in the logic gate tutorial and moves on from there to the logic gate puzzles, followed by 
levels containing binary arithmetic puzzles in a similar format. The game currently ends with a boss fight. 

In the levels focused on the logic gates, the user will activate and deactivate buttons that are connected 
to gates. The gates can be connected to each other as well as to a door or platform to solve the level. The 
user will need to use what is learned in the tutorials to solve the puzzle levels.

Similarly to the logic gate levels, the binary puzzle levels will have gates that function the same way; 
however, the focus is the binary arithmetic which is interacted with by colliding with the arrays that 
contains the spaces required to create the binary representation of the goal number. Sometimes it will 
have a button at the start that will change the representation type to be either unsigned representation, 
signed representation, or 2's complement. Bit values that have diagonal lines across them cannot be changed.

After the binary levels, the user will start a boss level featuring a worm that is defeated using the binary 
numbers learned previously will. The worm is defeated by hitting the binary sections of its body to create 
the number on the platforms it pauses on. The start of the number will be at the head of the worm. After 
defeating the boss, the player will be able to return to the hub.
