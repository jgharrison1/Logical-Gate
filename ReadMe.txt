Logical Gate is an educational game in a 2D platformer style covering logic gates, binary arithmetic, and memory management.

The user can access the game on the Unity Play website with the following link:
https://play.unity.com/en/games/a5b0fca3-47d5-4fdc-80fa-e37b429c7480/logical-gate
and search for Logical Gate. Click the Logical Gate window, and then click play. The game will start at the title screen.

The game utilizes standard keyboard controls, moving the character with the 'w','a','s', and 'd' keys. The 'a' and 'd' will move left or right respectively; the 'w' key is the key to jump; the 's' key can be used to fall through platforms on specific platforms in the game. The player can also slow their falling speed while wall sliding, which is done by holding down the 'a' or 'd' key to push into a wall. While wall-sliding, the player can "wall jump", by hitting 'w' while wall sliding. 

The game starts in the logic gate hub and begins with an introductory cut-scene and moves on from there to the logic gate puzzles, followed by levels containing binary arithmetic puzzles, and then finally the memory management levels. After the player finishes the memory management levels, they will then proceed to a boos fight. 

In the levels focused on the logic gates, the user will activate and deactivate buttons that are connected to gates. The gates can be connected to each other as well as to a door or platform to solve the level. The user will need to use what is learned in the tutorials to solve the puzzle levels.

Similarly to the logic gate levels, the binary puzzle levels will have gates that function the same way; however, the focus is the binary arithmetic which is interacted with by colliding with the arrays that contains the spaces required to create the binary representation of the goal number. Sometimes it will have a button at the start that will change the representation type to be either unsigned representation, signed representation, or 2's complement. Bit values that have diagonal lines across them cannot be changed.

After the binary levels, the user will then go to the memory management section. In this section, the player will learn about how memory management is done through paging. The user will learn about the page numbers, offsets, and frame numbers and how they work in the secondary memory, the page table, and the main memory. After finishing the memory management levels, the player will be able to access the boss fight.

After the memory management section, the user will start a boss level featuring a worm that is defeated using the binary math concepts learned previously. The worm is defeated by hitting the binary sections of its body to create the number on the platforms it pauses on. The start of the number (most significant bit) will be just after the head of the worm.
